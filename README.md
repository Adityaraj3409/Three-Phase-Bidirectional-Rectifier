# Three-Phase Bidirectional PWM Rectifier with dq Vector Control (EV Charger)

A MATLAB/Simulink implementation of a grid-connected three-phase bidirectional rectifier using synchronous dq-axis vector control for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) operation.
This project demonstrates advanced power electronics control including PLL synchronization, decoupled current control, and bidirectional power flow between the AC grid and battery-based DC bus.
